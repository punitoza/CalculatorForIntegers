Hello,

This is the README file for the application - CalculatorForIntegers. This application parses the expression passed by the user
while invoking the main method as command line arguments and then performs the calculation as specified by the expression. More
details regarding the requirements specifications are in the RequirementSpecs.docx file.

Please refer the file 
*********
Calculator-UML-Diagram.png
********* for understanding the class hierarchy used in this application.

*********
The application has the test package that defines the test suite and about 30 test cases.
*********

Running the test suite will run all the 30 tests.

The application accepts 2 parameters on the command line - first one is a required parameter and it is the expression that needs to be
evaluated. Second parameter is the verbosity level of the log. This parameter is optional. If it is omitted then the default log level of INFO
will be set. If passed, it has to be among error, debug and off - case in-sensitive. If any other value is passed, then default value will be
used which is INFO.

As the output, it prints the final result of the expression.

*********
The continus integration is enabled on this repository via Travis-CI

For any questions, please feel free to leave a comment on the github.

Thank you,
Punit Oza
